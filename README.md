# Alternte icon for darktable

## Does darktable need a new Icon?
No, of course not. This is just a personal playground. This is to combine the open source software [darktable](http://www.darktable.org/) and my love for simple icons / logos.


## Simplify

My goal is to simplify the darktable application icon. The logo 1.) is pulled from the application version 2.6.2. See the gradient and the shadow effect.

The [website](http://www.darktable.org/) is using a different type of the logo: 2.). It is slightly cleaner, as it comes without the shadow and uses solid colors. 
I can see the attempt to simplify the logo. I like this idea. From my understanding the logo needs to be simplified even more. At the same time, I do not want to rethink darktables logo entierly. I think a re-design needs to be made carefully.

Besides changing some parts, I want to stick to the following:
- the color 
- the simple shape, e.g. circle
- the tilted aperture blades

To make the appearance more tidy and cleaner, I want to get rid of the black circle underneath the aperture blades. In my opinion the centered white spot is unnecessary. See theses steps in 3.) and 4.)

### Dimmed icon

To fulfill the request for a less distracting app icon in the top section of the darktable window, find a dimmed version here icons/idbutton-grey.svg _for using it, you'd need to rename it to_ idbutton.svg _and place it into the folder_ pixmaps.
